For years, video games have garnered the attention of people worldwide, providing a unique environment for entertainment, education, scientific problem solving, promotion of health awareness, and socialization. With the increase of video games' popularity, a critical question arises: how to keep a player engaged?   

In this dissertation, I focus on increasing player engagement, where I define engagement as the continued desire to play a game repeatedly during one session or over a longer period of time. I propose three recommendation systems targeting different types of in-game elements. I focus on online match-based games, where players competitively play against others. Further, I focus on recommendations in the pre-match stage. My hypothesis is that the recommendation systems I developed will increase player engagement by giving players the ability to make informed choices concerning in-game elements, such as which characters to play as, which items to equip, or which opponents to play against. My theoretical foundation for this work is based on two psychological theories that have shaped understanding of player sustained engagement in games: Self Determination and Flow. In such theories, scholars have shown that competence, or the ability of a player to feel competent given the tasks they are doing within the game, has a direct relation to sustained engagement, or the desire to play the game repeatedly, Additionally, Flow theory describes a state of 'flow' where players are sufficiently challenged, where the task they are doing is neither too easy or too hard. Based on these theories, the recommendation systems I propose recommend in-game elements to players that influence players' in-game choices, and subsequently will have an impact on the way they play, competence they perceive, and eventually their engagement. 

To develop these recommendation systems, I explored two related research questions. The first research question is concerned with the question of how to develop effective and efficient recommendation systems that can recommend in-game elements that will have a winning potential for players, in both one-vs-one and team-vs-team settings. Targeting this question allows us to focus on developing experiences that are not frustratingly hard to players, and thus help players win more. It should be noted that these systems can also work in reverse, meaning they can also suggest items that make players lose. The second research question is concerned with studying how to balance win/loss of matches through designing in-game element recommendation systems which directly improve player engagement in relation to win/loss ratio and its impact on churn.

For the first research question I propose two systems: (a) \textit{Q-DeckRec} a recommendation system for one-vs-one Collectible Card Games (CCGs). In these types of games, the player often starts with a deck of cards of their choice. Q-DeckRec recommends winning-effective decks. This system presents a novel approach to search a large space of possible card decks to recommend, using minimal computational resources after a training phase. In addition to cards as starting items to recommend, many games such as MOBA (Multi-player Online Battle Arena) games require players to select a set of characters to play with against another team. For these types of games, I propose (b) \textit{DraftArtist}, a recommendation system that recommends winning-effective characters. This proposed system presents a novel contribution that efficiently searches for the best possible characters to recommend given a large number of possibilities, uncertainty caused by not knowing what the other team will select, and the desirability to select characters that synergize teammates and counter the opponents. Using a match outcome prediction model trained on real data, we find that teams following our recommendation algorithm have higher predicted win rates against teams constructed by other character selection strategies. Our algorithm maintains sufficient efficiency to be deployed in real-world scenarios.

For the second research question, I propose an opponent recommendation system, called \textit{Engagement-Optimized Matchmaking} (EOMM). EOMM is the first system that formally treated matchmaking as an optimization problem to maximize player engagement quantitatively. Our system shows significant improvement in enhancing population-wise player engagement as compared to other matchmaking methods.

The contribution of my dissertation is in developing three novel recommendation systems that target improving player engagement through increasing competence by giving players in-game element recommendation that increase possibility of a players feeling competent or entering a state of Flow by either increasing the probability of them winning or balancing the win/loss ratio to decrease the probability that they leave the game. There are much work left for future research, such as studying systems tailored for more specific types of in-game elements, as well as those which can make central decisions on different types of recommendations for any particular player.


% Such variety and richness     match outcomes are believed to be closely related to player engagement and revenues made by game companies. Based on individual players' information and game contexts, personalized recommendation is one family of proposed methods, wherein dynamic game contents are recommended to players in order to influence their win rates. 

% investigating the close relationship in-game competence and player engagement. 

% As there can be various goals for influencing game outcomes and video games sport different designs and in-game elements, I am not able to examine every place where in-game element recommendation can be applied. Rather, I focus on the following boundaries delimiting my research.

% EOMM presents a new way of thinking opponent recommendation as an optimization problem which can be solved through a graph matching algorithm. 

% The connections between the three proposed recommendation systems are as follows. All the systems use recommendations as a means to influence game outcomes. They can be indirectly or directly used to improve player engagement. The starting item and character recommendation systems aim for increasing the win rate for one player, which can be seen as an indirect step to improve player engagement because they need to work with other systems which decide when to deliver recommendations, while EOMM directly operates on the optimization of population-wise player engagement as the criterion for influencing game outcomes for multiple players.

% In each match, human players (and possibly computer agents) compete with each other.
% First, I focus on recommendations in the pre-match stage in video games played based on small sessions called matches. In the pre-match stage, some in-game elements determined before the match starts could already have an impact on the final match outcome and player engagement.
% Second, I focus on two goals for employing recommendations to influence game outcomes: to increase a player's win rate and to increase player engagement. The two goals are progressive, in a sense that increasing a player's win rate is an intermediate and indirect step to improve player engagement.
% Third, I focus on the recommendations of three specific types of in-game elements: starting items, in-game characters and opponents. These are very common in-game elements in video games nowadays. However, identifying right recommendations of them face different challenges: (1) I propose  personalized recommendation system for suggesting starting items  to optimal for a player's win rate. It could be a challenging task for the player to choose winning-effective starting items since a large amount of choices could be available depending on the strategies of the player and the opponent; (2) I propose an in-game character recommendation system for suggesting team-based video games with the goal to maximize a player's win rate.Last, I propose a matchmaking system for opponent recommendation, in which expected match outcomes within recommended opponents optimize all involved players' engagement. 

% A distinctive feature of personalized recommendation in PvP games is that influencing one's winning probability will adversely change that of the opponent(s) who are human players too. The initial item recommendation system exemplifies \textit{how} match outcomes can be affected positively \textit{from one side}, while the opponent recommendation system exemplifies not only \textit{how} but also \textit{how much} match outcomes should be influenced when we consider \textit{a population of players}.
